    <hr><p>Hi! I'm <b>PAVAN RAJA MODUMUDI</b> and I'm on a journey to become a full-stack Java developer.
        I recently graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, and while I gain valuable experience working part-time at Tata AIG.<br/>
        I'm taking the initiative to expand my skillset by learning full-stack Java development at<i><B><u> Naresh IT Hyderabad</u></i></b></i>.
        Full-stack development involves building both the front-end (HTML,CSS,JAVASCRIPT) and back-end (javacore,advancejava) of web applications
        By learning Java, a versatile programming language, I'm aiming to master skills in creating interactive user experiences, managing data on the server, and ensuring smooth communication between these parts.
        This comprehensive training will equip me to design and develop web applications from scratch, making me a well-rounded developer in the tech industry.
